Feature content in a JavaScript powered slideshow gallery showcase on your WordPress website

== Description ==

Feature content in beatiful and fast JavaScript powered slideshow gallery showcases on your WordPress website.

You can easily display multiple galleries throughout your WordPress website displaying your custom added slides, slide galleries or showing slides from WordPress posts/pages.

The slideshow is flexible, all aspects can easily be configured and embedding/hardcoding the slideshow gallery is a breeze. 

See the <a href="http://tribulant.net/slideshowgallery/">online demonstration</a>.

Here are several ways to display a slideshow: 

= Shortcode for all slides =

To embed a slideshow with all slides under **Slideshow > Manage Slides** in the plugin, simply insert the shortcode below into the content of a post/page.

`[tribulant_slideshow]`

= Shortcode for featured posts =

You can create a slideshow from featured posts, each post being a slide and it's featured image used as the slide image. The link of the slide will be the link of the post so clicking on the slide will take users to that post.

Here is a sample shortcode that you can use for this:

`[tribulant_slideshow featured="true" featurednumber="10" featuredtype="post"]`

= Shortcode for a gallery's slides =

To embed a slideshow with slides from a specific gallery under **Slideshow > Manage Galleries** in the plugin, simply insert the shortcode below (where X is the ID value of the gallery) into the content of a post/page.

`[tribulant_slideshow gallery_id="X"]`

= Shortcode for the images of a WordPress post/page =

To embed a slideshow with the images uploaded to a WordPress post/page through it's media gallery, simply insert the shortcode below (where X is the ID value of the post). Whether you want to display the images from a post or a page, the parameter remains `post_id`.

`[tribulant_slideshow post_id="X"]`

= Shortcode for latest/featured products =

In order to display latest or featured products in a slideshow, you need the <a href="http://tribulant.com/plugins/view/10/wordpress-shopping-cart-plugin" title="WordPress Shopping Cart">Shopping Cart plugin</a> from Tribulant Software. Once you have this installed and activated, you can easily display recent or featured products. To display recent products use the shortcode below. 

`[tribulant_slideshow products="latest"]`

And to display featured products, use the one below. 

`[tribulant_slideshow products="featured"]`

For both, you can use the `productsnumber` parameter to limit the number of products eg. 

`[tribulant_slideshow products="latest" productsnumber="5"]`

= Hardcode into any plugin/theme with PHP =

To hardcode into any PHP file of your WordPress theme, simply use 

`<?php if (function_exists('slideshow')) { slideshow($output = true, $gallery_id = false, $post_id = false, $params = array()); } ?>`.

= Parameters for shortcode/hardcode to customize each slideshow =

You can use any of the following parameters with both the hardcoding and shortcode to customize each slideshow gallery:

Shortcode Ex 1: 

`[tribulant_slideshow layout="responsive" gallery_id="3" auto="true" navopacity="0" showthumbs="true"]`

Shortcode Ex 2: 

`[tribulant_slideshow layout="specific" post_id="379" width="600" height="300" auto="false" showinfo="false"]`

Hardcode Ex 1: 

`<?php slideshow(true, 3, false, array('layout' => "responsive", 'auto' => "true", 'navopacity' => "0", 'showthumbs' => "true")); ?>`

Hardcode Ex 2: 

`<?php slideshow(true, false, 379, array('layout' => "specific", 'width' => "600", 'height' => "300", 'auto' => "false", 'showinfo' => "false")); ?>`

This way you can customize each slideshow you embed or hardcode, despite the settings you saved under **Slideshow > Configuration**.
